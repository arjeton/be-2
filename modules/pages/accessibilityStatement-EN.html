<h1>Accessibility Statement for Patent e-Filing Portal</h1>

      <br />
      <p>This is an accessibility statement for Patent e-Filing Portal</p>

      <p>
        The SPB strives to make its web presence as accessible as possible to people with disabilities, 
        in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative 
        (WAI) and Government Decree of 2003 April 18, No. 480. Some parts of our digital services are more accessible
        than others, but our aim is that they should all be at least level "A" compliant with the WAI guidelines.
        Many services are already "AA" compliant, and our ultimate goal is to achieve "AA" compliance wherever possible.

      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
        define requirements for designers and developers to improve 
        accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and 
        Level AAA. This digital service is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means
        that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

      <p>Known limitations and bugs for digital service "Patent e-Filing Portal" of the SPB:</p>

      <br />

      <ul>
        <li><b>Contrast</b><br />
          Minor elements may not provide sufficient contrast of 3:1 or 4.5:1 to match the WCAG 2.1 AA criteria. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Missing alternate text or role for images </b><br />
          Some images may not provide alternative text or a role of none/presentation. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Missing labels for icon-buttons or form elements</b><br />
          Not all icon-buttons or form elements may provide a correct label. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Incorrect order of headings</b><br />
          Some pages or content parts may not provide a semantically correct heading order. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Landmark structure</b><br />
          Landmark structure currently covers the minimum requirements and is planned to be improved in future releases. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Keyboard access</b><br />
          Not all UI-elements provide the targeted goal for keyboard access. Some UI-controls and elements are currently not
          accessible for keyboard and AT users.  Several UI-controls display additional secondary information via tooltips
          and currently only via mouseover. In case essential information is not accessible via keyboard, please report
          the found issue if not already mentioned here.  
        </li>
        <li><b>Aria-Labels</b><br />
          Provided labels via WAI-ARIA may not be descriptive enough to match the expected behaviour. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Focus indicator</b><br />
          The provided or browser standard focus indicator sometimes is cropped by a parent container, not clearly visible
          or hidden due to a coding bug or missing focus management. In case the focus gets lost, so the indicator gets
          invisible, pressing TAB key again until the focus indicator is visible again can solve this problem.
        </li>
        <li><b>Text scaling / Browser zoom</b><br />
          Depending on the used service, user scaled font-sizes or browser zoom with high values above 150% may result in
          unexpected behaviour like e.g. cropping of elements or horizontal scrolling. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Limited support for devices/viewports </b><br />
          Not all digital services are optimized for all combinations of devices and viewports. Some of our services require
          a minimum viewport and display size to offer a good user experience for our visitors. E.g. when a service or website
          is not usable to your satisfaction on a certain device like your smartphone, we recommend to use the service via
          desktop, laptop or a tablet device.
