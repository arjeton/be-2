    The  "epoline (r) Online Filing software (eOLF) software" which you may
    download is a software that supports the online electronic filing of
    intellectual property documents and hereinafter is referred to as
    "the Program".

    Copyright (r) 2005 European Patent Organisation

    The European Patent Organisation has made available the source code to pave
    the way for the system to become a world standard for Intellectual Property
    document archiving and to facilitate document exchange between offices,
    which will reduce costs for applicants and increase efficiencies within the
    offices.

    To accomplish this goal a Release Board has been formed to ensure the
    maximum possible international uniformity in this area. The members of this
    Release Board are various governmental and intergovernmental
    administrations: EPO, USPTO, JPO, WIPO and several other interested
    organisations. For details about the Release Board and how to become a
    member thereof see http://eolf.sourceforge.net.

    You are requested to provide your modifications and contributions on the
    Program to the eOLF Open Source community on
    http://eolf.sourceforge.net, so as to make it possible for the Release
    Board to assess them and incorporate them into a new certified release of
    the Program.

    You can redistribute this Program and/or modify it in accordance with the
    terms of the European Patent Organisation Open Source Licence No. 2005/1.

    This Program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
