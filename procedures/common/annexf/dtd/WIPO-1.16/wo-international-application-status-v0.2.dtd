  After patent citations the most common citations are articles within serials
  (periodicals, magazines), books and electronic (eg. internet) sources.
  This is a very complex and varied area to standardise. The tag set below is drawn
  from a number of sources as is the order of the tags (which in any case can be
  changed depending on the stylesheet used).;

  The order of tags is that of WIPO ST.14 / ISO 690 layout.
