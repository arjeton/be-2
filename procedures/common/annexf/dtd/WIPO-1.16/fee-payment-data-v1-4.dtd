<!--
INTENDED TRANSMISSION FREQUENCY
A fee-payment-data XML file is expected to be transmitted at the same time as a payment is made to the International Bureau and its total value must correspond to the value of the actual payment.

Most offices transmit one payment and one file per month.  Any corrections to amounts previously transmitted for IAs are shown as records in subsequent transmissions, noting that each fee-payment breakdown file should always indicate a the same total amount as the value of the actual transmitted payment. This ensures that the total value for the breakdowns is consistent with the total value for actual payments while allowing corrections to be made to the data for each IA to ensure that at the IA level the values are also correct.
FOR NETTING....
The XML file is intended to correspond to payment values adjusted by the netting team based on a separate credit management system
a more complete DTD was proposed aiming to cover the IA level payments and credits used in the Netting process, but this was declined
-->
<!--
FILE NAMING
The naming convention preferred is one that is consistent in structure with the Minimal specification for the transfer of documents to the international Bureau, 
The required naming is as follows; 
RO-IB-yyyymmdd-fpay-nnnnn-en.xml where
	RO is the ST.3 code for the sending office 
	IB is the ST.3 code for the destination office (will always be IB)
	yyyymmdd is the date of transfer
	fpay is a fixed string identifying the type of transfer
	nnnnn is the sequence number (may be reset annually)
	en is the language code (always en as currency codes always expressed in English).
The file is expected to be transferred as an uncompressed xml file to the PCT-EDI 'upload' directory.

Example file name sequence (using RO Australia as the example sending office):
AU-IB-20090127-fpay-00001-en.xml
	AU-IB-20090224-fpay-00002-en.xml
AU-IB-20090325-fpay-00003-en.xml
FOR NETTING
File nameing will start with two Office codes one of which must be IB  (e.g. EP-IB or IB-AU) , noting that it does not support AU-EP as IB is the Hub.

HEADER COMENTS
Comments are required in the XML header to aid manual identification of files because automatic matching of fee-payment-breakdown instances to actual bank transfers received at WIPO is not possible; this task is done manually. These comments, inserted immediately after the DOCTYPE entry, should be formatted as in the following example of a bank transfer from EPO to WIPO of  4553000 Euros sent on May 1st 2004, with the bank transfer comment 'APRIL 2004':
-->
<!-- EPO transferred to WIPO  --> 
<!--bank-transfer-total 4553000 --> 
<!--bank-transfer-date 20040501 -->
<!--bank-transfer-currency EUR -->  
<!--bank-transfer-comment APRIL 2004 -->
<!--
Attributes of fee-payment-data:
  dtd-version = dtd version number
  file = filename containg the XML instance
  status = status of the file ( n - new, c - correction (or replacement))
  country = Receiving office code (ST.3)
  date-produced = YYYYMMDD e.g, 20011230
  total-handling-fee = the total value of all handling fees transmitted in the 
  reduction-type = flag to advise how fee reductions have been applied to the payment values (integrated or separate )
There are two possibilities for the implementation of fee reductions namely 'integrated' or 'separate'. The default is 'separate' where a separate fee-reduction element is used to indicate the value of the reduction from the IA. The alternate is 'integrated' where the value of the reduction is integrated into the value of the other fee elements for the IA. This choice is denoted in the value of the optional attribute of fee-payment-data.
