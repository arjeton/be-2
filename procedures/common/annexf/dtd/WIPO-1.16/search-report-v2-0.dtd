  Notes:

  This DTD is intended to process stand-alone search reports (SR) sent to the
  applicant - use search-report-data when included in patent-doc.: xx-patent-
  document.dtd
  Namely the ISR (PCT) and the EPO SR.

  This DTD is based on:
  Form PCT/ISA/201 Jan. 2004 (International-type SR)
  Form PCT/ISA/210 Jan. 2004 (main SR)
  Form PCT/ISA/220 Jan. 2004 (transmittal)
  Form PCT/ISA/237 Jan. 2004 (written opinion)

  Some stylesheet info. has been put in in most places according to the NEW ISR
  layout - it needs more detailed instructions and will need changing for the
  published ISR as part of the PCT pamphlet.

  It is recommended to use the new layout and not the "box" layout of current paper
  forms.

Attributes:
  id =
  file          = filename of the whole application
  lang          = language of application - use ISO639 language code
  status        = status of the application; values: new = new application
  date-produced = YYYYMMDD e.g, 20011230 if desired, 12 characters maximum
  search-type   = type of search expected values are: 
                   isr for International Search Report 
                   sisr for Supplementary International Search Report
                   international-type for international type search report
                   national for national search-reports
                   national-supplementary for supplementary national search reports
  srep-type     = type of search with detailed office specific values allowed
  srep-office   = Searching office, country code ST.3
  dtd-version   = dtd version number
  form-version = form version number. e.g. "201501"

chooses to express the fact that the cited document has no equivalent document / patent family members in the 
rendered search report citation; in other words the attribute when present and having the value "no" will result in the text 
"No patent family" or "No equivalent documents" in the relevant language being displayed on the search report.

  PATENT CITATIONS:
    (ST.32:B561)
  Patent Citation within abstract, description or claims.
  For patent citations within Search Report see Search Report DTD

  Notes:
    Tags arranged according to WIPO ST.14 order.
    This can be free text data without any structure (text).

  Example:
    <patcit id='pcit0001' dnum='US4793675A' dnum-type='publication number'>
      <document-id>

  Note:
    It is NOT expected that the applicant will create the tagged data

  Attributes (recommended):
    id   - pcit0001, pcit0002, etc.
    num  - 0001, 0002, etc.
    dnum - use full number as one string, eg, "US5401234A";
    url  - where possible give full web link to patent
    file - file name eg. if stored on local systems
    dnum-type - type of document number

  Article citations within a 'host' document

  After patent citations the most common citations are articles within serials
  (periodicals, magazines), books and electronic (eg. internet) sources.
  This is a very complex and varied area to standardise. The tag set below is drawn
  from a number of sources as is the order of the tags (which in any case can be
  changed depending on the stylesheet used).;

  The order of tags is that of WIPO ST.14 / ISO 690 layout.
