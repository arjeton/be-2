chooses to express the fact that the cited document has no equivalent document / patent family members in the 
rendered search report citation; in other words the attribute when present and having the value “no” will result in the text 
“No patent family” or “No equivalent documents” in the relevant language being displayed on the search report.

 the effect of postponing the entry into the national phase until 30 months from
 the priority date (or later in some Offices) (Article 39(1)) and the acts for entry
 into the national phase must therefore be performed within 20 months from the
 priority date (or later in some Offices). However, in respect of some other Offices,
 the time limit of 30 months (or later) may nevertheless apply. See the Annex to
 Form PCT/IB/301 and, for details about the applicable time limits, Office by Office,

  Article citations within a 'host' document

  After patent citations the most common citations are articles within serials
  (periodicals, magazines), books and electronic (eg. internet) sources.
  This is a very complex and varied area to standardise. The tag set below is drawn
  from a number of sources as is the order of the tags (which in any case can be
  changed depending on the stylesheet used).;

  The order of tags is that of WIPO ST.14 / ISO 690 layout.
    DROP, J.G.  Integrated Circuit Personalization at the Module Level. IBM Tech.
    Dis. Bull.  October 1974, Vol. 17, No. 5, p. 1344 and 1345.
