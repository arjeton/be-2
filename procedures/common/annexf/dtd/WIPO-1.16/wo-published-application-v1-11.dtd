  SEQUENCE LISTING
    According to WIPO ST.25: STANDARD FOR THE PRESENTATION OF NUCLEOTIDE AND
    AMINO ACID SEQUENCE LISTINGS IN PATENT APPLICATIONS:
      see http://www.wipo.int/scit/en/index.html
    "The sequence listing as defined in paragraph 2(i) shall, where it is filed
    together with the application, be placed at the end of the description
    part of the application. This part shall be entitled Sequence Listing, 
    begin on a new page and preferably have independent page numbering. 
    The sequence listing forms an integral part of the description; it is therefore 
    unnecessary, subject to paragraph 36, to describe the sequences elsewhere 
    in the description." Therefore we create here a separate sub-document for 
    sequence listings, it should follow any drawings or the claims.
    It should follow the format of Annex C/ST.25 and be an external file

  Notes:
    Tags arranged according to WIPO ST.14 order.
    This can be free text data without any structure (text).

  Example:
    <patcit id='pcit0001' dnum='US4793675A' dnum-type='publication number'>

  Article citations within a 'host' document

  After patent citations the most common citations are articles within serials
  (periodicals, magazines), books and electronic (eg. internet) sources.
  This is a very complex and varied area to standardise. The tag set below is drawn
  from a number of sources as is the order of the tags (which in any case can be
  changed depending on the stylesheet used).;

  The order of tags is that of WIPO ST.14 / ISO 690 layout.
    DROP, J.G.  Integrated Circuit Personalization at the Module Level. IBM Tech.
    Dis. Bull.  October 1974, Vol. 17, No. 5, p. 1344 and 1345.
