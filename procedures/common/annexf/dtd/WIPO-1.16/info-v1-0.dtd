* IPC DATA - NEW IPC8
*******************************
International Patent Classification (IPC) data;
- to be implemented in 2006
- use B510 for until week 52, 2005
- see: http://www.wipo.int/scit/en/standards/pdf/03-08-01.pdf:

Industrial property offices are asked to implement this new version of Standard ST.8 for
all patent documents with a publication date from January 1, 2006, onwards. For patent
documents published prior to that date, the previous version of the Standard should
continue to be used.
. . .
This recording convention provides that symbols of the International Patent
Classification (IPC) should be
presented on machine-readable records for the exchange of information in
machine-readable form in a fixed-length field in 50 positions, each part of
the Int. Cl. symbol being recorded in specific positions and in the manner prescribed.
- this can be recorded within the <text> tag.

Position(s) Content Values

1 Section A-H
2 to 3 Class 01-99
4 Subclass A-Z
5 to 8 Main Group (right aligned) 1-9999, blank
9 Separating character / ("Slash")
10 to 15 Subgroup (left aligned) 00-999999 blank
16 to 19 For future use 4 blanks
20 to 27 Version indicator YYYYMMDD date format
28 Classification level C, A, S
29 First or later position of symbol F, L
30 Classification value (inventive or non-inventive) I, N
31 to 38 Action date YYYYMMDD date format
39 Original or reclassified data BRVD
40 Source of classification data H M G
41-42 Generating office AA ZZ (ST.3)
43-50 For future use 8 blanks

EPO usage:
- we will NOT use the detailed element markup as listed below (it is far too heavy)
- we will use "a fixed-length field in 50 positions" as specified above

EPO layout:
- for the title page to be determined

Example:

<B510EP>
<classification-ipcr sequence="1">
<text>B28B...5/00........20060101AFI20070601BHEP........</text>
</classification-ipcr>

<!ELEMENT ipc-version-indicator  (date) >

<!--Position 28 : Classification level
Offices are expected to classify each subject matter only in one level (core or advanced).
However, both levels need to be completely represented in the master classification database
and thus a level indicator is needed. The level indicator is also useful for indicating
situations where an office does not classify in either the core or the advanced level
classification, i.e., when an office only assigns classifications to the subclass level.
The level indicator enables to make the difference between core, advanced and subclass levels.
The letters C (Core), A (Advanced) and S (Subclass) are
used for this one-digit field.

Levels: ipcr-advanced, ipcr-core

new subdivisions.

<!--Positions 41-42: Generating Office
Since part of the original data in the advanced level and
the reclassified data can be delivered by offices other than the
publishing office, the information source of such data is
recorded by a field of two characters. The country or office
code CC, as defined by WIPO Standard ST.3, must be used.

<!--Position 39: Original and reclassified data
Original data is the first data assigned to the document.
In case of a publishing office assigning classification symbols at
the core level, another office may also assign symbols at
the advanced level as original data.
Reclassified data is data changed due to a change in the classification schemes.
Various data is data changed due to an incidental reclassification
of an individual document, such as the correction of a mistake.
Deleted data is data which has to be deleted from the
Master Classification Database, due to a change in assigning of
classification symbols to a document.

The indication of the different types of data is marked by the letters B for the basic or original data,
R for reclassified data, V for various incidental changes, and D for data to be deleted.
Possible status: original-classification, reclassified, various-classification, deleted-classification
-->
<!ELEMENT classification-status  (#PCDATA) >

<!--Position 40: Source of classification data
The following sources of classification data are foreseen:
- Intellectual classification by persons,
value H for human generated data.
- Machine classification by the propagation of earlier
intellectual classification through the use of common
priorities in the patent application.
The value M is used in this case and will facilitate later corrections.
- Classification symbols generated by software using automatic
analysis of the content of the patent document.
The letter G is used to indicate this source of generated data.
